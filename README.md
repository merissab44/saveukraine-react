# JavaScript Foundations Final Project

Welcome to my final project!

This site is mainly for journalists covering the russian vs Ukranian war. Recording of russian soldires have been accumulated over radio fequencies. This site is made for people to submit their recordings and have interpreters to understand what's going on.

@BrianRoss93 was the mind behind creating this site I just wanted to help bring it to life! 

Hopefully many people find use out of the site and hopefully end the war soon.
If you can interpret russian please reach out to either @iimfarout on twitter or @merissacodes1
