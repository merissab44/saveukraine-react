            "description": "This was recorded on 27/02/22 on frequency 7933 USB. I believe this is to be a ground team or tank team, Alot of call signs were said in this such as buran 30, skala, lampaz28 and a few more. Also kolonika which maybe a collum of vehicles in the north or a single fuel supply truck. In this recording coordinated were also mention which i believe to be around west kyiv. They were requesting air support and kept mentioning a battery. They also mentioned talking with some other people bu buran30 could not hear them. This buran30 seem to be on this frequency a lot calling out for people. He also mentioned that he could not talk loud because of nearby recon? there is much more information in this recording but i don't know Russian so i was relying on translators. ",
